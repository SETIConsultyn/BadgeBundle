This bundle provides a management of badges for user, support for Symfony2 application.

BadgeBundle is created to management of badges for user at site web.

A badge is an object that the user gets when it meets minimum requirements.

The persistence is storage agnostic. Any backend may be implemented: Doctrine, Propel, etc.
Presently, only the OMR implementation is complete.

The Bundle works correctly. 

If you have any suggestion or improvement, feel free to contact me or create an issue.
